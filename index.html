        <p>Internet, websites, and coding is the main point on this reading. Differences on fluid pages and how coding is being used to create spaces and web pages. The differences in adding more elements that separate images and text, vertical and horizontal websites have different functions into them. The use of typefaces, weights, and placement are important to shift things around. As an interface using text is what makes websites special, large images show a way of attraction when they get to use them. Treating the web is an element that should be focused on, using an image and replacing them to create a bigger piece to have an actual web is a way of communicating to go through the website. The use of hierarchy is what makes these websites stand out and let others want to use them. Image choices and layout would completely change the perspective of the website. Responsive designs are meant to choose a way of making users navigate through the website and have a way of looking at elements. Edglessness is the structure of the web, and it is the element that makes things work as what they should be. </p>
